## Codex execution

Paths are repository-relative unless explicitly relative to this skill. Use the session's file-reading/editing tools and shell (`rg --files` for globs, `rg` for search; `rg --pcre2` when lookarounds are required). Tool labels such as Read/Grep/Glob/Write/Edit/Bash below describe operations, not required tool names. Load another skill by reading its available `SKILL.md`; pass the user's arguments in text.

Ask unresolved questions with an available question tool in the current mode, or in conversation; accept free text and preserve pending decisions until answered. Respect the tool's actual batch limit. Prior authorization remains valid; never treat silence as approval. Maintain progress in the workflow's existing artifact/checklist rather than tool-specific task IDs.

For reader delegation, read `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` and pass its developer instructions, inputs, repository root and applicable AGENTS/rule paths explicitly. Use named agents only when supported and permitted. Otherwise perform that exact read-only contract sequentially, including its filters, read bounds and output shape; this has no separate sandbox. Reader-only bounded reads are allowed in this fallback in addition to the caller's own reads. Do not fix a model or reasoning level.

Context7 may be replaced by official documentation for the installed library version when unavailable; record the fallback. Missing custom rule directories under `docs/codex/planning-rules/` mean no custom rules. Persistent commands use a retained shell session or `docker compose exec -d`, followed by readiness checks. Figma evidence-dependent steps use `docs/codex/figma-workflow.md`; missing capabilities must be reported, never fabricated.


Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **available question tool or conversation** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Use **available question tool or conversation** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically `tasks.md`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Use **available question tool or conversation** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Check for delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`. If none exist, proceed without sync prompt.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Show a combined summary before prompting

   **Prompt options:**
   - If changes needed: "Sync now (recommended)", "Archive without syncing"
   - If already synced: "Archive now", "Sync anyway", "Cancel"

   If the user chooses sync, apply the assessed delta to `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` with the available editing tools: create absent capability specs with Purpose and Requirements; add ADDED requirements, replace each MODIFIED requirement in full, apply RENAMED headings, and remove only REMOVED requirements. Preserve unrelated requirements and scenarios. Verify the resulting specs with `openspec validate --specs --strict` before moving the change; stop on validation errors. If the user explicitly skips sync, proceed without those edits.

5. **Perform the archive**

   Create the archive directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p openspec/changes/archive
   ```

   Generate target name using current date: `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>`

   **Check if target already exists:**
   - If yes: Fail with error, suggest renaming existing archive or using different date
   - If no: Move the change directory to archive

   ```bash
   mv openspec/changes/<name> openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
   ```

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or "No delta specs" or "Sync skipped")

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (openspec status --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If sync is requested, follow the delta reconciliation procedure in step 4
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting
