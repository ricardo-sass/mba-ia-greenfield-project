## Codex execution

Paths are repository-relative unless explicitly relative to this skill. Use the session's file-reading/editing tools and shell (`rg --files` for globs, `rg` for search; `rg --pcre2` when lookarounds are required). Tool labels such as Read/Grep/Glob/Write/Edit/Bash below describe operations, not required tool names. Load another skill by reading its available `SKILL.md`; pass the user's arguments in text.

Ask unresolved questions with an available question tool in the current mode, or in conversation; accept free text and preserve pending decisions until answered. Respect the tool's actual batch limit. Prior authorization remains valid; never treat silence as approval. Maintain progress in the workflow's existing artifact/checklist rather than tool-specific task IDs.

For reader delegation, read `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` and pass its developer instructions, inputs, repository root and applicable AGENTS/rule paths explicitly. Use named agents only when supported and permitted. Otherwise perform that exact read-only contract sequentially, including its filters, read bounds and output shape; this has no separate sandbox. Reader-only bounded reads are allowed in this fallback in addition to the caller's own reads. Do not fix a model or reasoning level.

Context7 may be replaced by official documentation for the installed library version when unavailable; record the fallback. Missing custom rule directories under `docs/codex/planning-rules/` mean no custom rules. Persistent commands use a retained shell session or `docker compose exec -d`, followed by readiness checks. Figma evidence-dependent steps use `docs/codex/figma-workflow.md`; missing capabilities must be reported, never fabricated.


Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run $openspec-apply-change

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **available question tool or conversation** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with `.openspec.yaml`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **available planning tool and artifact checklist** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **available question tool or conversation** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `$openspec-apply-change` or ask me to implement to start working on the tasks."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
