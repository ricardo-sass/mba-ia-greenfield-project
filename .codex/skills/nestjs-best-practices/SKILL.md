## Codex execution

Paths are repository-relative unless explicitly relative to this skill. Use the session's file-reading/editing tools and shell (`rg --files` for globs, `rg` for search; `rg --pcre2` when lookarounds are required). Tool labels such as Read/Grep/Glob/Write/Edit/Bash below describe operations, not required tool names. Load another skill by reading its available `SKILL.md`; pass the user's arguments in text.

Ask unresolved questions with an available question tool in the current mode, or in conversation; accept free text and preserve pending decisions until answered. Respect the tool's actual batch limit. Prior authorization remains valid; never treat silence as approval. Maintain progress in the workflow's existing artifact/checklist rather than tool-specific task IDs.

For reader delegation, read `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` and pass its developer instructions, inputs, repository root and applicable AGENTS/rule paths explicitly. Use named agents only when supported and permitted. Otherwise perform that exact read-only contract sequentially, including its filters, read bounds and output shape; this has no separate sandbox. Reader-only bounded reads are allowed in this fallback in addition to the caller's own reads. Do not fix a model or reasoning level.

Context7 may be replaced by official documentation for the installed library version when unavailable; record the fallback. Missing custom rule directories under `docs/codex/planning-rules/` mean no custom rules. Persistent commands use a retained shell session or `docker compose exec -d`, followed by readiness checks. Figma evidence-dependent steps use `docs/codex/figma-workflow.md`; missing capabilities must be reported, never fabricated.


# NestJS Best Practices

Comprehensive best practices guide for NestJS applications. Contains 40 rules across 10 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.

## When to Apply

Apply these guidelines during **planning and implementation** of NestJS features:

- **Planning phase:** When designing module architecture, defining service boundaries, or choosing patterns for a new feature in `nestjs-project/`
- **Implementation phase:** When writing or modifying controllers, services, guards, pipes, interceptors, entities, or repositories
- **Auth & Security:** When implementing authentication, authorization, guards, or input validation
- **Database:** When creating entities, repositories, migrations, or optimizing queries with TypeORM
- **Testing:** When writing unit or e2e tests for NestJS modules
- **Code Review:** When reviewing NestJS code for architecture, security, or performance issues

### When NOT to Apply

Do not load this skill when:

- Only reading or exploring NestJS code to understand it, without intent to plan or implement changes
- Working on frontend code (Next.js, React components) even if it consumes the NestJS API
- Answering general TypeScript or Node.js questions that don't involve NestJS framework patterns
- Discussing high-level project requirements without NestJS implementation scope

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Architecture | CRITICAL | `arch-` |
| 2 | Dependency Injection | CRITICAL | `di-` |
| 3 | Error Handling | HIGH | `error-` |
| 4 | Security | HIGH | `security-` |
| 5 | Performance | HIGH | `perf-` |
| 6 | Testing | MEDIUM-HIGH | `test-` |
| 7 | Database & ORM | MEDIUM-HIGH | `db-` |
| 8 | API Design | MEDIUM | `api-` |
| 9 | Microservices | MEDIUM | `micro-` |
| 10 | DevOps & Deployment | LOW-MEDIUM | `devops-` |
